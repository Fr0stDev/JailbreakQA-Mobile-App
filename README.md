##JailbreakQA [un]official mobile application

This is a very early attempt of making JailbreakQA mobile and easier to read/reply/ask without dealing with JailbreakQA's desktop site on MobileSafari.

While this may not be very useful to your average jailbreaker, it might come in handy for us (The volunteers at JailbreakQA). That being said, this app may or may not be submitted to a Cydia repository. 

Why I did this? The subject kept coming up. I figured maybe this would be a neat idea. 

##Contribution

The app is open sourced with the intent that you, developers, will contribute to finishing this application. I certainly can't do it alone, and >1 developers are better than 1. 

So.. Please feel free to contribute to this app by forking it & submitting pull requests to this repository. 

##To-Do List

There's a lot of work to be done! Here is the things I have in mind:

- Improve UI
- <del>Some clean up</del>
- <del>Reply to question</del>
- Login through twitter/open-id

P.S: This project uses ARC.
